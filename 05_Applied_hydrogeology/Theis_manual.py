st.markdown('''
            The **Theis type curve plot** is a fundamental tool in hydrogeology for analyzing **transient groundwater flow** in response to well pumping. It is based on the **Theis solution**, which describes how drawdown evolves over time in a **confined aquifer**.
            
            By plotting **dimensionless drawdown** against **dimensionless time** on a logarithmic scale, the type curve provides a theoretical reference for evaluating aquifer properties. This approach is widely used to estimate **transmissivity (T)** and **storativity (S)** by matching field observations to the type curve.
            
            To determine the aquifer properties, the **Theis type curve** must be aligned with the measured data using a **matching point**—a reference point where both curves coincide. In this step, you can **define the matching point manually**, selecting a representative coordinate on the plot to scale the type curve accordingly. Typically, a **representative coordinate** is chosen where the curves overlap well and is often set to **simple values (e.g., 1, 10, or 100)** to make calculations easier and reduce errors in parameter estimation.
            
            Below, you can plot the Theis type curve with a user-defined matching point. You also have the option to download the figure for further study.

        If many expert hydrogeologists matched a Theis curve to the data, they would all have a slightly different values of $T$ and $S$, but the parameter sets would likely all be close enough to the values of the aquifer $T$ and $S$ to draw comparable conclusions, and make similar predictions of drawdown for other distances from the well and for longer time than the duration of the test. While adjusting parameter values, one finds that the ideal data can be matched very well to the Theis curve. The reason for this behavior is that the ideal aquifer data conform to the conditions for applying the Theis solution.
