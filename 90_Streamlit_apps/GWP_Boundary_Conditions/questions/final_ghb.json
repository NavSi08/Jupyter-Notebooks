    "question": "Which statements best describe how a General Head Boundary (GHB) behaves? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "The flow direction depends on the difference between $H_B$ and $h_{aq}$.": true,
      "A GHB always enforces a constant discharge.": false,
      "A GHB allows variable inflow and outflow.": true,
      "GHBs are only used at the top of the model.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. GHBs simulate dynamic exchange driven by head differences.",
    "error": "❌ GHBs allow variable flow and are not restricted to a model's top layer."

    "question": "Which expression correctly defines the flow across a GHB? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "$Q_B = C_B(H_B - h_{aq})$": true,
      "$Q_B = K (H_B - h_{aq})$": false,
      "$Q_B = C_B h_{aq}$": false,
      "$Q_B = H_B / C_B$": false

    "success": "✅ Well done. The GHB flow equation linearly links flow to the head difference.",

      "The boundary acts as a recharge zone.": false,
      "The flow direction reverses.": false,
      "The conductance drops to zero.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. When heads equalize, there is no driving force for flow.",
    "error": "❌ No head difference means no flow across the boundary."

      "Increases the slope of the Q–h plot.": true,

      "Recharge applied elsewhere in the model": false,
      "Conductance $C_B$": true

    "success": "✅ Correct. Flow is governed by conductance and the head difference.",
    "error": "❌ Recharge affects heads, but not directly the GHB flow equation."

      "When $Q_B < 0$": false,
      "When flow enters the aquifer": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly. The GHB adds water to the aquifer when its head is higher.",
    "error": "❌ A gaining boundary means water flows into the aquifer from the boundary."
