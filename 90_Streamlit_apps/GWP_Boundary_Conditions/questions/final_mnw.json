    "question": "What is a primary advantage of using MNW over WEL in groundwater modeling? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) It allows distributed flow over multiple layers": true,
      "B) It includes skin and well loss effects": true,
      "C) It simplifies pumping without parameters": false,
      "D) It enforces pumping constraints": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Great — MNW includes realistic physics and constraints.",
    "error": "❌ WEL is simpler. MNW models multiple nodes and head-dependent limits."

      "A) Hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer": true,

      "C) Drain elevation": false,
      "D) Cross-sectional area of flow": true
    },

    "question": "What happens to the Q–h curve of a MNW when a maximum pumping rate is applied? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) The curve flattens at the Qmax value": true,
      "B) Flow increases indefinitely with head": false,
      "C) Flow reverses direction": false,
      "D) Flow stops if head is too low": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly. The curve reflects constraints and head-based behavior.",
    "error": "❌ Think of operational limits — flow won’t just grow forever."
  },
  {
    "question": "In MODFLOW, which parameter causes an MNW to stop pumping due to head constraints? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Hlim (limiting head)": true,
      "B) Qmax": false,
      "C) Recharge rate": false,
      "D) Minimum saturated thickness": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Spot on. MNW can stop pumping if the cell head drops below Hlim or becomes unsaturated.",
    "error": "❌ MNW shutdowns are triggered by limiting heads, not just flux rates."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is skin effect incorporated in an MNW? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) As an additional resistance around the wellbore": true,
      "B) As an increase in conductance": false,
      "C) Through the use of hydraulic gradient multipliers": false,
      "D) As a correction to head loss": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Skin effect reduces flow — it’s a resistance term included in conductance calculations.",
    "error": "❌ Skin effect adds resistance, not conductance or gradients."

    },
    "success": "✅ Well done. Q–h plots make MNW behavior easier to interpret and debug.",
    "error": "❌ Focus on what Q–h plots reveal about flow constraints and system response."
