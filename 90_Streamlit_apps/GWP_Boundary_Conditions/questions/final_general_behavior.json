    "question": "Why is a defined-head boundary represented as a horizontal line in a Q–h plot?",
    "options": {
      "Because the head remains constant regardless of flow rate.": true,
      "Because the flow rate remains constant.": false,
      "Because the aquifer has no recharge.": false,
      "Because it reflects external control, like a large river or lake.": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! In Dirichlet conditions, head is fixed; Q varies. It often reflects external controls like rivers.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. Remember: it's the head that is fixed, not the flow."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which characteristics best describe a head-dependent boundary (Robin condition)?",
    "options": {
      "The flow depends on the difference between aquifer head and external head.": true,
      "It involves a conductance term that controls how easily flow occurs.": true,
      "The head is always equal to the river stage.": false,
      "It results in zero flow under all conditions.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! Head-dependent flux is based on the head difference times a conductance value.",
    "error": "❌ Incorrect. Only when heads are equal is the flow zero — not always."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens in the model if recharge is increased while keeping boundary types unchanged?",
    "options": {
      "The hydraulic head generally increases across the domain.": true,
      "The discharge at the defined-head or river boundary increases.": true,
      "The conductance of the river boundary decreases.": false,
      "The position of the no-flow boundary changes.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! Recharge increases head and thus outflow, but boundary conditions and geometry remain fixed.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. Recharge changes system input, not conductance or boundary placement."
  },
  {
    "question": "In which of the following cases does the Q–h plot appear as a vertical line?",
    "options": {
      "Defined-head boundary.": false,
      "No-flow boundary.": true,
      "Recharge point with constant flux.": true,
      "Head-dependent boundary with high conductance.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! Neumann (defined-flow) boundaries have fixed Q, so the Q–h plot is vertical.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. Vertical Q–h lines occur when flow is fixed regardless of head — typical for no-flow and recharge."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which statements correctly describe the influence of hydraulic conductivity (K) in the 1D model?",
    "options": {
      "Higher K values result in flatter hydraulic head gradients.": true,
      "Lower K values result in steeper head gradients for the same recharge.": true,
      "K affects the shape of the Q–h plot at a defined-head boundary.": false,
      "K has no influence on the computed discharge in the system.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! K controls the aquifer’s ability to transmit water and affects head gradients and flow distribution.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. K does affect gradients and system behavior — but not the Q–h curve of a Dirichlet boundary."
  },
  {
    "question": "In a 1D model with recharge and a no-flow boundary, which of the following are true?",
    "options": {
      "Flow is directed away from the no-flow boundary.": true,
      "Recharge causes a rising water table towards the no-flow boundary.": true,
      "The Q–h plot at the no-flow boundary shows a flat line.": false,
      "Head-dependent flow occurs at the no-flow boundary.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! No-flow boundaries force one-directional flow; recharge raises head, but no flow occurs at the boundary.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. Q–h at no-flow is vertical (Q = 0, variable h), and no head-dependent exchange occurs there."
