    Each stakeholder will place a different value on a given drawdown. Utility _U_ is a way to normalize these values.
    
    Consider a stakeholder for whom more drawdown is a worse outcome.    
    * They would assign U = 0 to a drawdown associated with the worst outcome ... further drawdown cannot make things any worse.
    * They would assign U = 1 to a drawdown associated with the best outcome ... less drawdown would not make things any better.
    
    This could be a very complicated function and, in reality, it is very difficult to define.
    
    To get a feel for it, we will use a simple linear function between two threshhold drawdown values.
    
    To define the function, you identify the drawdown _s_ values that you want to associate with U = 0 and U = 1. The utility then varies linearly between these points.
    
    Note that if the drawdown for U = 1 is lower than the drawdown for U = 0, then the stakeholder prefers less drawdown. Conversely if the drawdown for U = 1 is higher than the drawdown for U = 0, then the stakeholder prefers more drawdown.
    
    Give it a try for the following conditions.
    * A stakeholder decides that U = 0 is associated with a drawdown of 0.5 m and U = 1 corresponds to a drawdown of 0.05.
    * Repeat if a stakeholder decides that U = 1 is associated with a drawdown of 0.5 m and U = 0 corresponds to a drawdown of 0.05.
    

    ðŸ‘‰ Develop a utility curve for the town and be prepared to explain your choices.
    
    ðŸ‘‰ Develop a utility curve for the environment and be prepared to explain your choices.
    
    In the previous exercise, you were told that:
    
    - The mine requires a minimum drawdown of 5 m and a maximum drawdown of 7 m.
    - Develop a utility curve for the mine.
    
    ðŸ‘‰ Discuss why different stakeholders may have a different time at which they would assess utility.
    
    Come up with a decision that you have to make in your life:
    
    - What is the STATE upon which you make the decision.
    - What is the OUTCOME upon which you make the decision.
    - Define the outcomes that define utilities of 0 and 1
    - Create a utility curve to relate the state to the utility
    
    ðŸ‘‰ Discuss how utility framing may help you to make a more efficient and effective decision.
