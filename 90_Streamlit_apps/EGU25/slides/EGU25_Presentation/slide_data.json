Only a very small fraction is freshwater \u2014 and most of that is locked in glaciers and ice caps, making it largely unavailable for human use.\u000bThe accessible portion \u2014 the water we can realistically use \u2014 is mainly groundwater.\u000bThe right figure, from 2011, illustrates the global state of groundwater usage.\u000bDark-colored regions indicate areas where groundwater abstraction exceeds mean annual recharge, pointing to unsustainable use. These areas are under significant stress and highlight the urgency of better groundwater management."
