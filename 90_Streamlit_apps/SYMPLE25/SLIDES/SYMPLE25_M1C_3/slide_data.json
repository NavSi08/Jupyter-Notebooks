An efficient computation can be very beneficial for subsequent model use like uncertainty analysis and automatic calibration, where the numerical model is executed several times."

Rather, it is frequently sufficient to define appropriate vertical conductivities between adjacent model layers (\u201cleaky aquifer\u201c)."
