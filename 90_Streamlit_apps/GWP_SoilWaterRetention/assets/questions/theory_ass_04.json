    "question": "What does the term *field capacity* ($\\theta_{fc}$) refer to?",
    "options": {
      "The point where soil becomes completely saturated": false,
      "The water content after gravity drainage slows down": true,
      "The water content at permanent wilting point": false,
      "The maximum water the soil can ever hold": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! Field capacity is the water retained in soil after drainage has mostly stopped.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. Field capacity is the moisture level after gravitational water has drained, not saturation."

    "question": "Which of the following best describes *available water capacity (AWC)*?",
    "options": {
      "The amount of water between saturation and field capacity": false,
      "The water volume the soil can hold when fully saturated": false,
      "The difference between field capacity and wilting point": true,
      "The amount of water stored in large pores": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly! AWC is the water available for plants, between field capacity and wilting point.",

    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! The wilting point is typically set at −15,000 cm of pressure head.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. It's −15,000 cm, indicating strong suction where plants can no longer extract water."

    },
    "success": "✅ That's right! The retention curve helps determine irrigation needs and avoid drought stress.",
    "error": "❌ Not correct. The retention curve is most useful for managing plant water availability."
