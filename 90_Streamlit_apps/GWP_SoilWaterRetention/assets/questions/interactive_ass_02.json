      "A) Increase $\\theta_s$": true,

      "C) Slightly reduce $\\alpha$": true,
      "D) Lower $n$ to nearly 1": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. Widening the gap between FC and PWP increases eFC.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. Think in terms of shifting the limits of the retention curve."

    "question": "A) What are the effects of a high $\\alpha$ value in the retention curve? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) The curve shifts left toward lower suctions": true,
      "B) The air-entry point occurs earlier": true,
      "C) Saturated water content increases": false,
      "D) The PWP moves to higher water contents": false
    },

      "A) Increasing $n$": true,

      "C) Increasing $\\theta_r$": false,
      "D) Reducing $\\alpha$": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. A higher $n$ value makes the curve more abrupt in its transition.",

      "A) The soil's ability to transmit water under unsaturated conditions": true,
      "B) The slope of the retention curve near saturation": false,
      "C) A dimensionless value between 0 and 1": true,
      "D) The inverse of the air-entry pressure": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. $k_r$ reflects water transmission efficiency as a function of saturation.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. $k_r$ is a saturation-dependent measure of conductivity."

      "A) $\\theta_s \\approx 0.35$, $\\alpha > 0.1$, $n > 2$": true,

    "question": "A) How does increasing $\\theta_r$ affect $k_r$ and soil water availability? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) It narrows the range of plant-available water": true,
      "B) It shifts the $k_r(\\theta)$ curve to higher water contents": true,
      "C) It raises saturated conductivity": false,
      "D) It enhances pore connectivity at low saturation": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. Higher $\\theta_r$ reduces eFC and delays conductivity onset.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. $\\theta_r$ reduces effective saturation and hydraulic transmission."
