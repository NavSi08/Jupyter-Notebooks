"question": "What does a soil water retention curve represent? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
"options": {
"A) The relationship between water content and pore size": false,
"B) The relationship between soil water content and capillary pressure": true,
"C) How strongly water is held in soil pores at varying moisture levels": true,
"D) The rate of vertical infiltration in saturated media": false
},
"success": "✅ Correct. Retention curves link water content to capillary suction and describe retention strength.",
"error": "❌ Not quite. The retention curve shows water content vs. suction, not infiltration or pore size directly."
},
{
"question": "What typically characterizes the 'field capacity' point on a retention curve? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
"options": {
"A) Water is held against gravity but still available to plants": true,
"B) The capillary pressure head is typically around −100 to −300 cm": true,
"C) All pores are completely drained": false,
"D) The soil is saturated": false
},
"success": "✅ Yes. Field capacity marks the upper limit of plant-available water, after drainage slows.",
"error": "❌ Field capacity is below saturation and not associated with complete drainage."
},
{
"question": "Which terms describe characteristic points on a retention curve? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
"options": {
"A) Saturation point": false,
"B) Wilting point": true,
"C) Field capacity": true,
"D) Residual water content": true
},
"success": "✅ Correct. Wilting point, field capacity, and residual content are key indices on the curve.",
"error": "❌ 'Saturation point' is not typically used as a defined retention curve index."
},
{
"question": "What is hysteresis in the context of soil water retention? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
"options": {
"A) A delay in infiltration after rainfall": false,
"B) A difference between drainage and wetting curves for the same soil": true,
"C) A result of pore-scale processes and wettability effects": true,
"D) A phase change between water and vapor in deep soil layers": false
},
"success": "✅ Well done. Hysteresis reflects differences in the retention behavior during drying vs. wetting.",
"error": "❌ Hysteresis refers to unequal retention curves due to pore and surface effects—not infiltration or vaporization."
