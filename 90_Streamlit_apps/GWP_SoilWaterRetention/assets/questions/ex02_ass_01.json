"question": "A) What defines the permanent wilting point (PWP) in the soil water retention curve? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
"options": {
"A) Water content at which plants permanently recover after stress": false,
"B) Water content at a suction of ~15000 cm (pF 4.2)": true,
"C) It is influenced by both θ_r and curve shape (α, n)": true,
"D) It is always equal to the residual water content": false
},
"success": "✅ Correct. PWP is typically defined at a suction of 15000 cm and is shaped by both θ_r and the model curve.",
"error": "❌ PWP is defined at pF 4.2, not by recovery or always equal to θ_r."
},
{
"question": "A) Which parameter most strongly controls the steepness of the retention curve? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
"options": {
"A) θ_s": false,
"B) n": true,
"C) α": true,
"D) θ_r": false
},
"success": "✅ Exactly. Both α and n shape how fast the soil desaturates.",
"error": "❌ θ_s and θ_r define the bounds, not the steepness."
},
{
"question": "A) What characterizes field capacity (FC) in the model? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
"options": {
"A) Water content at pF 1.8 (~63 cm suction)": true,
"B) It indicates the maximum plant-available water": false,
"C) It is the moisture held after gravity drainage": true,
"D) It occurs at saturation": false
},
"success": "✅ Yes. FC is defined after drainage and often set around 63 cm suction.",
"error": "❌ FC does not mean saturation and is not the same as maximum available water."
},
{
"question": "A) Which soil type typically has a steep SWRC and low PWP? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
"options": {
"A) Coarse sand": true,
"B) Silt loam": false,
"C) Clay": false,
"D) Loamy sand": true
},
"success": "✅ Correct. Coarser soils have sharp drainage and lower PWP.",
"error": "❌ Fine soils like clay retain more water and desaturate slowly."
