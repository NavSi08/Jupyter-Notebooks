      "A) Dataset 1 – fast drainage but limited storage": false,

      "D) All datasets are equally suitable": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Well done. Dataset 2 and 3 offer valuable storage, though clay may have limitations due to low kr.",
    "error": "❌ Consider both field capacity and kr when recommending for agriculture."

    "question": "A) How does the relative hydraulic conductivity (kr) curve support interpretation of soil suitability for infiltration? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Steeper kr decline means poor infiltration under unsaturated conditions": true,
      "B) High kr at low θ implies fast infiltration": true,
      "C) All soils have similar kr profiles": false,
      "D) kr is independent of texture": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. kr provides important insight into unsaturated flow potential and varies with texture.",
    "error": "❌ kr is a texture-dependent function and critical for flow behavior."
