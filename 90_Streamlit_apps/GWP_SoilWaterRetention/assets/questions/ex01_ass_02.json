"error": "❌ Not quite. Soil 1 drains rapidly and retains little moisture at high suction — that’s typical of sandy soils."

"A) Soil 2 = Sand": true,

"success": "✅ Correct – Soil 2 retains high moisture even under strong suction, a hallmark of silt-rich soils.",
"error": "❌ Try again. Soil 2 holds onto water over a wide suction range, which is characteristic of silt."
