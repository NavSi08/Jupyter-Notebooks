"question": "What does a soil water retention curve describe? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
"options": {
"A) The relationship between volumetric water content and suction pressure": true,
"B) The time it takes water to infiltrate a soil column": false,
"C) How tightly water is held in soil at different moisture levels": true,
"D) The pressure head required to achieve saturation": false
},
"success": "✅ Correct. Retention curves show how water content varies with suction (capillary pressure).",
"error": "❌ It describes θ–suction relations, not infiltration time or saturation mechanics."
},
{
"question": "What are typical physical bounds of volumetric water content in soil? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
"options": {
"A) Between θr and θs": true,
"B) Always less than θr": false,
"C) Never exceeds θs": true,
"D) Can be negative under extreme suction": false
},
"success": "✅ Correct. θ should always lie between residual and saturated values.",
"error": "❌ Water content is bounded: it cannot exceed θs or be less than θr."
},
{
"question": "What does the α parameter in the van Genuchten model represent? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
"options": {
"A) The inverse of air-entry suction": true,
"B) A scaling factor for suction head": true,
"C) A measure of pore-size uniformity": false,
"D) The hydraulic conductivity of the soil": false
},
"success": "✅ Yes! α controls where the curve begins to drop and is inversely related to air-entry pressure.",
"error": "❌ α is not a conductivity or pore-size uniformity term."
},
{
"question": "Which variables are directly used in the van Genuchten retention equation? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
"options": {
"A) Saturated and residual water content (θs, θr)": true,
"B) Suction pressure head (h)": true,
"C) Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks)": false,
"D) van Genuchten shape parameters (α, n)": true
},
"success": "✅ Correct. θs, θr, α, n, and h are inputs to the retention function.",
"error": "❌ Ks is not part of the retention equation — only used for K(h) later."
