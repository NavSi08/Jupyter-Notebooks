    "question": "Which physical mechanisms contribute to the formation of capillary pressure in unsaturated soils?",
    "options": {
      "Cohesive forces between water molecules": true,
      "Adhesive forces between water and soil grains": true,
      "Gravitational pull acting on the water mass": false,
      "Electrostatic repulsion between air molecules": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! Capillary pressure arises from cohesive and adhesive forces at curved interfaces.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. Think about how water interacts with itself and with the soil surfaces."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens to the capillary rise when the radius of a pore decreases?",
    "options": {
      "Capillary rise increases": true,
      "Capillary rise decreases": false,
      "Capillary pressure increases": true,
      "Capillary pressure decreases": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! Smaller pores result in higher capillary rise and stronger suction.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. Try recalling the Young–Laplace equation and its relationship to pore radius."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of the following statements about field capacity and wilting point are correct?",
    "options": {
      "Field capacity corresponds to the water content after gravity drainage slows down": true,
      "Wilting point indicates the minimum water content for plant survival": true,
      "Field capacity is defined at -15,000 cm pressure head": false,
      "Wilting point is defined at -100 to -300 cm pressure head": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Yes! Field capacity and wilting point define the plant-available water range.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. Be careful with the pressure head values associated with each term."

  {
    "question": "How does the relative hydraulic conductivity $K_r$ typically behave as soils dry?",
    "options": {
      "It increases": false,
      "It decreases": true,
      "It remains constant": false,
      "It approaches zero in very dry soils": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. As soils dry, water pathways shrink, and $K_r$ drops significantly.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. Think about how water moves in dry vs. wet conditions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which parameters are required to describe the van Genuchten water retention curve?",
    "options": {
      "$\\theta_r$ (residual water content)": true,
      "$\\theta_s$ (saturated water content)": true,
      "$\\alpha$ (inverse air-entry suction)": true,
      "$n$ (pore-size distribution)": true,
      "$K_s$ (saturated hydraulic conductivity)": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly. All except $K_s$ describe the retention curve itself.",
    "error": "❌ Not quite. Focus on the equation for the water retention curve."

  {
    "question": "Which processes can lead to hysteresis in the soil water retention curve?",
    "options": {
      "Differences between drainage and imbibition paths": true,
      "Pore structure changes during wetting and drying": true,
      "Gravity acting on water in coarse soils": false,
      "Entrapment of air bubbles during infiltration": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. Hysteresis arises due to pore-scale effects and phase entrapment.",
    "error": "❌ Try again. Not all of these directly relate to hysteresis mechanisms."
