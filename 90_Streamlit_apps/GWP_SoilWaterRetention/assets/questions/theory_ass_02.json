"question": "Which parameters influence capillary pressure according to the Young–Laplace equation? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
"options": {
"A) Surface tension of the liquid": true,
"B) Radius of curvature of the meniscus": true,
"C) Soil porosity": false,
"D) Contact angle between liquid and solid": true
},
"success": "✅ Correct. Capillary pressure depends on surface tension, contact angle, and meniscus radius.",
"error": "❌ Capillary pressure does not depend on porosity but is influenced by interfacial properties and geometry."
},
{
"question": "What happens to capillary pressure when the pore radius decreases? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
"options": {
"A) Capillary pressure increases (becomes more negative)": true,
"B) Capillary pressure decreases": false,
"C) Water is retained more tightly in the smaller pores": true,
"D) Gravity dominates and drains the water more easily": false
},
"success": "✅ Yes! Smaller pores amplify capillary forces, increasing suction and retaining water more tightly.",
"error": "❌ Capillary pressure increases with decreasing pore size—this helps retain water in fine pores."
},
{
"question": "Which conditions favor upward capillary movement of water in soil? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
"options": {
"A) Fine pores with small radius of curvature": true,
"B) High capillary suction (negative pressure head)": true,
"C) Fully saturated soil profile": false,
"D) Contact angles greater than 90°": false
},
"success": "✅ Correct. Capillarity is strongest in fine pores with strong suction and good wetting conditions.",
"error": "❌ Upward movement is driven by capillary suction in unsaturated soils, not in fully saturated or non-wetting conditions."
},
{
"question": "Why can water remain suspended in soil after infiltration has stopped? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
"options": {
"A) Capillary suction holds water in small pores": true,
"B) Pore-scale forces overcome gravity in unsaturated soils": true,
"C) Hydrostatic pressure becomes positive": false,
"D) Matric potential becomes constant": false
},
"success": "✅ Well done. Capillary and matric forces retain water even without flow.",
"error": "❌ Capillary suction and pore-scale forces—not positive pressure—allow water to remain held in soil."
