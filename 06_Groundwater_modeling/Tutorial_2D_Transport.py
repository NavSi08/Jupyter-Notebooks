Both scenarios are idealized in such a way that solute transport can be also computed with analytical solutions. This approach allows the user to understand the system, and to compare the results from the numerical model with the ‚Äòprecise‚Äô analytical solution. Accordingly, the user gets a proper understanding of the benefits and limitations of the different methods. The scenarios and models are subsequently described.

**This app contains** materials, explanations, descriptions (as To-Do list), and videos on how to setup a MODFLOW/MT3D model for a 2D idealized catchment (see the following figure).

    #### Question/Purpose of the model
    
    **üü• Scenario A:** The general aim is the prediction and management of a contamination plume with constant release of solutes. To simulate the spreading of a solute from a point source in a confined, homogeneous and isotropic aquifer. The solute is introduced with a constant concentration. Observations exist at 100, 300, 500, and 1000 m distances.
    
    The situation is idealized and can be compared with the results of an analytical solution (2D solute transport from a continuous source with advection and dispersion). The analytical solution allows users to investigate the effects of different settings of the numerical model, like solution scheme and discretization.
    
    **üü© Scenario B:** The general aim of this version is to use the numerical model to simulate a tracer test to characterize the aquifer. The solute is injected with a given mass over a very short term. The injection is a point source, i.e., the tracer is inserted through a point source as a Dirac impulse (10 liters in 10 seconds, containing 1,000 g NaCl). The observation is at a distance of 30 m.
    
    ---
    
    #### Conceptual model
    
    The confined aquifer is homogeneous and isotropic and sufficiently extends in the horizontal direction. The thickness of the confined aquifer is constant. Groundwater flows in a steady and uniform flow field with a defined specific velocity *q*, based on:
    
    Hydraulic gradient: *i* = 0.005  
    Hydraulic conductivity: *K* = 0.001 m/s
    
    Equation:
    
    $$
    q = -Ki = -0.001 \\times 0.005 = 5 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m/s} \\; (0.432 \\text{ m/d})
    $$
    
    Solute input configurations:
    - **üü• Scenario A:** Areal source with constant concentration; width of source is 100 m.
    - **üü© Scenario B:** Point source with slug input. Total mass input is 1,000 g in 10 liters.
    
    ---
    
    #### Mathematical model and analytical solution
    
    The analytical solutions for both scenarios are provided in two dedicated Streamlit apps:
    
    - **üü• Scenario A:** [transport-2d-continuous.streamlit.app](https://transport-2d-continuous.streamlit.app/)
    - **üü© Scenario B:** [transport-2d-dirac.streamlit.app](https://transport-2d-dirac.streamlit.app/)
    
    ---
    
    #### Numerical model ‚Äì flow and transport
    
    **Model characteristics:**

    - Model top at 0 m, aquifer thickness: 10 m
    - Horizontal extent: 2500 m √ó 1100 m
    - Initial cell size: 100 m √ó 100 m
    - Hydraulic conductivity *K* = 1√ó10‚Åª¬≥ m/s
    - Specified-head boundaries on west and east edges

    **üü• Scenario A:**
    - Temporal discretization: 1 period (steady state), duration 86,400,000 s (1,000 days)
    - Contamination source from *x* = 300 to 400 m (central row)
    - Defined concentration boundary: *c* = 1 g/m¬≥
    - Observations at 100, 300, 500, and 1,000 m downstream
    - Purpose: Predict solute transport over 1,000 days

    - Temporal discretization: 3 periods

      - Period 2: 10 s (injection, transient)

      - Infiltration rate: 0.001 m¬≥/s for 10 s
