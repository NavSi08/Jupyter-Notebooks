    "question": "Which of the following statements about the FD (finite difference) scheme are true? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) FD can introduce numerical dispersion": true,
      "B) FD is highly accurate for sharp concentration fronts": false,
      "C) FD uses grid-based discretization of the advection-dispersion equation": true,
      "D) FD computes transport along streamlines directly": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct! FD operates on a grid and often causes numerical dispersion.",
    "error": "❌ FD simulates transport on a grid and is prone to numerical dispersion, especially near sharp fronts."

    "question": "Which of the following are true about the MOC method in MT3D? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) MOC traces particles along flow paths": true,
      "B) MOC requires grid-based concentration values at every node": false,
      "C) MOC is better suited for advection-dominated transport": true,
      "D) MOC has a higher risk of mass balance errors": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Yes — MOC is particle-based and well-suited for advection, though mass balance issues may arise.",
    "error": "❌ MOC follows particle paths, does not compute grid concentrations directly, and can lead to mass balance discrepancies."

  {
    "question": "What effect does setting the dispersion coefficient (alpha) to zero have in MOC?",
    "options": {
      "A) It disables all dispersion processes": true,
      "B) It creates a uniform concentration field": false,
      "C) It allows for direct comparison with pure advection": true,
      "D) It improves mass balance": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct — setting alpha to zero allows you to isolate advective transport.",
    "error": "❌ Alpha = 0 removes dispersion, which is useful for evaluating advection-only behavior."

  {
    "question": "Which of the following influence the precision of a MOC simulation? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Number of initial particles": true,
      "B) Grid spacing": false,
      "C) Time step size": true,
      "D) Number of moving particles per cell": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Well done — particle count and time stepping strongly affect MOC results.",
    "error": "❌ Grid spacing is less relevant in MOC; particle settings and timestep are critical."
