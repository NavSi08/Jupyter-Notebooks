    "question": "What settings are required to simulate conservative solute transport in MT3D using the FD scheme? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Activate BTN, ADV, DSP, SSM, and GCC packages": true,
      "B) Set ADV to MOC method": false,
      "C) Set ADV to Finite Difference (FD)": true,
      "D) Deactivate dispersion": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct – FD transport requires specific packages and FD solver setting.",

    "options": {
      "A) A point object linked to SSM": true,
      "B) A well boundary with constant flow": false,
      "C) Constant concentration value in SSM input": true,
      "D) Observation location defined before source": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly – Source definition requires object + concentration setting via SSM.",

      "B) Transverse dispersivity": true,
      "C) Flow direction": true,
      "D) Grid cell thickness": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct – Dispersion depends on alpha_L, alpha_T, and flow direction.",
    "error": "❌ Grid thickness is not relevant in 2D; dispersion is controlled by directional parameters."

      "C) Purely advective behavior": false,
      "D) Observation far from source": true
    },

    "error": "❌ Symmetric curves result from dispersion, not numerical issues or pure advection."

      "A) Low discrepancy (<1%) in listing file": true,

      "C) Consistent total mass in and out": true,
      "D) Symmetric particle paths": false

    "success": "✅ Mass balance should show small error and consistent mass accounting.",
    "error": "❌ Mass balance is about input–output consistency, not flow paths or heads."
