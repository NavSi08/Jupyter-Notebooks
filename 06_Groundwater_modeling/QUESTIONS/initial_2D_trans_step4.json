      "A) Ratio of advective to dispersive transport": true,
      "B) It helps determine numerical stability of FD methods": false,
      "C) A Peclet number ≫ 1 indicates dispersion dominates": false,
      "D) A Peclet number ≪ 1 indicates advection dominates": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct — The Peclet number compares advection and dispersion. A value ~1 indicates balanced transport.",
    "error": "❌ Peclet describes the ratio of advection to dispersion, not stability or which dominates."

      "C) It has no impact on Peclet": false,
      "D) It causes model instability": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct — Reducing grid size lowers the Peclet number and improves accuracy.",
    "error": "❌ Smaller cells reduce Peclet and help minimize numerical dispersion."
