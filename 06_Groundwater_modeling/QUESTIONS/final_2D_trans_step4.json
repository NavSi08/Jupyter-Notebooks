      "C) 0.1": false,
      "D) 100": false

      "C) MOC uses finite element basis functions": false,
      "D) MOC avoids numerical dispersion": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly — MOC tracks advective movement, avoiding grid-based dispersion issues.",

    "question": "Why is it helpful to temporarily set dispersivity (alpha) to 0 in MOC computations? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
