    "question": "What is the main difference between FD and MOC in simulating the Dirac tracer input?",
    "options": {
      "A) FD has more numerical dispersion.": true,
      "B) MOC shows sharper concentration peaks.": true,
      "C) FD shows faster runtimes.": true,
      "D) MOC does not need any spatial discretization.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Well done. MOC is sharper but requires more effort.",
    "error": "❌ Check differences in how FD and MOC solve transport equations."

  {
    "question": "What parameters were changed in the dispersion settings for Step 5?",
    "options": {
      "A) Dispersion was reduced to 5 m due to shorter transport distance.": true,
      "B) Dispersion was set to 20 m to simulate long-distance effects.": false,
      "C) Dispersion remained unchanged.": false,
      "D) Dispersion was disabled entirely.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. The scale-dependence of dispersion was applied here.",
    "error": "❌ Try again. Dispersion depends on transport distance."

  {
    "question": "Why is the WEL package used in this step?",
    "options": {
      "A) To simulate injection of the tracer.": true,
      "B) To model variable recharge.": false,
      "C) To define drain boundaries.": false,
      "D) To reduce computational time.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly. The well simulates the point-source injection.",
    "error": "❌ Think about how the tracer is introduced into the system."

  {
    "question": "How does MOC improve the accuracy for the Dirac impulse?",
    "options": {
      "A) Uses particles instead of grids.": true,
      "B) Tracks solute movement precisely.": true,
      "C) Is not affected by Peclet number.": true,
      "D) Replaces dispersion with degradation.": false
    },
    "success": "✅ MOC can simulate sharp pulses more realistically.",
    "error": "❌ Revisit the characteristics of MOC."
