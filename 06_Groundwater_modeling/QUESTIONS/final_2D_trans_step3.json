    "question": "What are key benefits of using the MOC approach in solute transport modeling? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) It avoids numerical dispersion": true,
      "B) It works efficiently with sharp concentration fronts": true,
      "C) It always provides mass-balanced results": false,
      "D) It is ideal for advection-dominated transport": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct — MOC is ideal for advection and avoids smearing of sharp fronts.",
    "error": "❌ MOC has strengths in advection-dominant cases, but can have mass balance issues."

      "A) Number of initially placed particles": true,
      "B) Cell thickness": false,
      "C) Number of moving particles": true,
      "D) Time stepping scheme": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Exactly — particle control and timestep are crucial for MOC refinement.",
    "error": "❌ Cell thickness is not relevant; it's about particles and time resolution."

    "question": "What happens if dispersion is removed from a MOC simulation?",
    "options": {
      "A) Only advection remains": true,
      "B) Solute spreads more widely": false,
      "C) Comparison to analytical advection solution becomes easier": true,
      "D) Simulation becomes unstable": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. This isolates advective behavior and helps model calibration.",
    "error": "❌ Removing dispersion isolates advection — a useful comparison case."

    "question": "Which challenges are associated with the MOC method? (Mark ALL correct answers)",
    "options": {
      "A) Numerical dispersion": false,
      "B) Mass balance error": true,
      "C) Long computation times": true,
      "D) Difficulty in modeling diffusive spreading": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Yes — MOC avoids numerical dispersion but may struggle with diffusion and runtime.",
    "error": "❌ MOC trades dispersion-free transport for mass balance and computational trade-offs."

  {
    "question": "Which of the following statements is true for comparing MOC vs FD in MT3D?",
    "options": {
      "A) FD has sharper fronts than MOC": false,
      "B) MOC is better for pulse injection tracking": true,
      "C) FD is faster for large domains": true,
      "D) MOC ensures perfect mass conservation": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Good. MOC tracks sharp pulses better; FD is faster but less precise.",
    "error": "❌ Consider both the physics and the computational implications of each method."

      "A) Compare to analytical solution": true,

      "C) Visualize particle paths only": false,
      "D) Check the mass balance in the listing file": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Excellent. You should validate with multiple tools — plots, curves, and balances.",
    "error": "❌ Don’t rely on just one output — validation includes curves, analytics, and mass checks."
