      "C) Less model stability": false,
      "D) Improved representation of gradients": true
    },
    "success": "✅ Yes. More accurate but computationally more demanding.",

    "question": "How can the model results be verified?",
    "options": {
      "A) By comparing to analytical solution": true,
      "B) By checking listing file mass balance": true,
      "C) By visualizing the concentration plume": true,
      "D) By reviewing streamlines from MODPATH": false

      "C) As a constant concentration": false,
      "D) Over a long time interval": false
    },
    "success": "✅ Correct. The Dirac pulse is sharp and short.",
    "error": "❌ Reconsider what 'impulse' means in time."
